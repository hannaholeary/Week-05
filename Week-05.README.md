# Week -05

## What I did this week

- This week I watched multiple tutorials regarding use case diagrams on Youtube
- I completed my Use Case Diagrams Assignment
- I finished some other projects for my two other modules
- I completed the Adobe XD essential training course on Linkedin

## What I am currently working on

- I am currently working on a podcast for the Creative Practice module

- I have started planning on producing a podcast with an old college friend of mine. I studied Criminal Justice and Psychology for my undergrad so I am looking forward to combining the knowledge of that degree with the skills I am acquiring with this Masters.

## What I am planning to do next week

- I would like to become more confident using the StarUML software to create use case diagrams without having to reference tutorials throughout the process. 

- I am planning on using the app and desktop version of Miro in order to collaborate with my classmates.
